# First Step into xCall Interoperability

> "On this path, it is only the first step that counts." - John Vianney

Making the first step into the interoperable world is undoubtedly an endeavor for a blockchain developer. Being an early adopter is both exciting and challenging at the same time.

This is why I have decided to summarize my first interaction with xCall and provide you with the documentation that will get you up to speed with xCall and a working example in no time.

From developer for developers.

## Ready, Steady, Go!
