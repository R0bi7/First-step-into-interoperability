# First step into xCall interoperability

” On this path, it is only the first step that counts. ” John Vianney

Making first step into interoperable world definitely is an endeavour for a blockchain developer.
Being an early adopter is both exciting and challenging at the same time.

This is why I have decided to summarize my first interaction with xCall and provide you with the documentation which should
get you up to speed with xCall and working example in no time.

From developer to developers.

## Ready, Steady, go!
